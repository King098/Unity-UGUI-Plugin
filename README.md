# Unity-UGUI-Plugin
To make UGUI use in the same way as NGUI,But it's not perfect!

Including event system,event scale animation,event sound play,colorful text,polygon texture button(but it's not very useful)...
Event System:Mouse Enter,Hover,Exit;Mouse Down,Up;Begin Drag ,Dragging,End Drag;Drop and so on.
A not perfect tool that can resize text by its content.
Some Sample!!!

Tips:
  Its not effective to use CompoentEventBase Event with UGUI ScrollRect,the event system will conflict,I have no idea in dealing with this problem!
